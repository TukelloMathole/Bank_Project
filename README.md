# Angular Tailwind CSS C# Web API Project

This project is a comprehensive web application developed using a combination of Angular for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a C# Web API for the backend. The application leverages a MSSQL database to store and manage data efficiently. Our development approach is grounded in the Entity Framework for robust database interactions, ensuring data integrity and seamless data manipulation.

We adhere to SOLID principles to maintain clean, scalable, and maintainable code. These principles help us ensure that our codebase remains flexible and easy to extend over time. Object-oriented programming (OOP) practices are at the core of our development process, promoting code reuse and encapsulation, which enhances the overall robustness of the application.
